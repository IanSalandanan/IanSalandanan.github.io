* Struggles that you have encountered while accomplishing LT0, LT1, and M1M2 (Guided Exercise 1)
* How you could improve your website in the future
* Other thoughts that might be noteworthy

-	I accomplished the items in the criteria by following the recommended video as a guide in creating a personal website from scratch. In terms of HTML, there was no issue for me since I have a basic knowledge of HTML so modifying the structure is okay for me. As for CSS selectors and styles, I understand how CSS styling works however it is quite challenging for me, so I followed the video and tried to understand how each selector and block of code works. Since I love how the website template mimics a minimalist site just like an Apple website, I decided to imitate the template and for the responsiveness, since I noticed that the final product lacks responsiveness, I decided to add transitions. Adding transitions makes the website livelier. The transition that I used was mostly triggered by hovering the mouse since I understand how it works in CSS.

-	While doing the LT0, LT1, and M1M2, I gained ideas on how HTML and CSS work together to form a website because I didnâ€™t study in advance with HTML and CSS language, so all the concepts were new to me. I admit that doing those tasks made me curious and started learning in advance, especially in HTML. 


-	I never had a struggle with HTML since it was a straightforward approach when you are coding, however, I got lost in starting my first task in CSS. The issue is that at first, I did not know how to link the selectors with HTML elements that I added in the HTML document.

-	I could improve my website by learning new transitions and adding them to my website, also I have a lot in mind, but I think that a formal or minimalist-looking website is more suitable especially when you are applying for a job. My goal is to retain its minimalist Apple theme however, I would like to experiment with different layouts and elements in the future. Some of my ideas are a circular photocard roulette for the project section and a switch button that will instantly convert all elements into dark mode. To emphasize, I have an idea for the dark mode, the background will change into a gif with a black background and green animated binary codes, and then all elements will look like actual elements syntax. The light mode is the front-end while the dark mode is the backend theme. 

-	Overall I enjoyed developing my personal website, because of this course, I am considering the possibility of being a web developer in the future.
